*This seems more convenient than a more robust backlog app if I'm doing solo development.

Item1: Fix username creation/update to ensure all usernames are unique --> necessary for follower/following relationships

Item2: Fix query for Followers

Item3: Add more localized behavior to the loading for explore-users.tsx (only block one submit button while loading instead of all)

Item4: Similarly, /explore/actions.ts should possibly not exist, it seems to unnecessarily complicate explore when it has only one function

Item5: Delete requests
